Working on adding a dash mechanic

2/4:
Working on the tempo mechanic, basically making this a rhythm shooter game thingy (see bullets per minute)

Update:
Starting work on the cursor

2/5:
Got the cursor and tempo working, now i need to get actions to sync with the tempo

2/6:
Working on making the player face the cursor, still trying to get actions to sync with tempo

2/7:
I think syncing is mostly good now, I wanna work on the actions now, mainly dashing

2/8:
Worked on the dashing, but not done.

2/10:
Dashing done, but tempo seems to be a little broken. I want to work on the weapons and shooting first before going to fix that

2/14: 
Fixed a little thing with the dash, and ive switched my focus to making the map and camera

Update:
Alright here's a little idea: randomly generated areas to survive in, probably a total of 5-7 rooms out of many

2/15:
Went back to weapons and shooting, was able to get bullets to spawn on mouse click.

2/18:
Got bullets to move

Gonna start on getting bullets to disappear on collision
